# Server Guidelines

We've gathered some guidelines, collected through experience over time, to make your experience in our server (and other communities on the internet) optimally pleasurable. Read them carefully and ask us if something is unclear, we promise it's worth the effort.

## Our guidelines

### Don't ask to ask, just ask

State your question. Do not ask if someone is around. You want *their* help, so don't be lazy and put in the effort of asking a good question. If nobody has a solution you can now take your fully written question to another place. No time wasted.

### Provide enough information

You can almost always never give too much information, but too little information makes it hard to help you. The harder you make it to help you, the less help you will get.

Explain what you want to achieve, what you've already done, and what issues you ran into.

Provide code, error messages, screenshots, a link to your project, anything that may be helpful.

### Sharing code

For a single line of code, wrap your code in single **\`** backticks.

Example:
`\`the_content()\``
Will display as:
`the_content()`

For multiple lines of code, wrap your code in three backticks on their own line. For syntax highlighting put the language on the top line immediately after the backticks.

Example:
```
\`\`\`php
function hello_world() {
    echo 'hello world';
}
\`\`\`
```
Will display as:
```php
function hello_world() {
    echo 'hello world';
}
```

To share more than 10-20 lines of code please use a code sharing service like CodePen, and paste the link between angle brackets to prevent it from showing an embed. Example: `<https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/XWPjzgR>`

### Do not promote DMs

Our rules explicitly state that unsollicited DMs are not allowed. Do not play around this rule by asking if you can DM someone, or if they can DM you, for no good reason.

We cannot moderate DMs. We won't know if your problem was solved or what you tried, and if your helper suddenly has to leave then nobody can continue where they left off.

If you would rather not have your site or username forever in our Discord logs, you can send it publicly, and edit your message after your conversation to say *redacted*.

### Video Tutorials

Video tutorials are in no way a comprehensive way to learn a subject. Videos should only be used to introduce a concept and add context so that reading the information directly from the source documentation can be easier to understand.

No video can replace the official documentation.

### Learning webdev with WordPress

WordPress is not a good tool to use to start learning web development. It obfuscates how HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP are used together to make pages and websites, which makes it much more difficult to understand.

Instead HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP should be learned separately, before attempting to learn WordPress.

### Asking the real question (The XY Problem)

You want to do X, but you don't know how. You think Y will get you X, but you don't know how to get Y either. Now you are asking for help with Y, but your secret true goal is X. The XY problem can waste a lot of time, so we must avoid it.

Don't ask about the potential solution you are thinking of, without mentioning the real problem. You'll get lots more potential solutions if you let people think about the broader picture.

### Do your research

You are expected to do your own research before requesting help. Google your problem, browse the documentation of whatever software product you are using, and try the potential solutions you find. Keep track of what worked, what didn't, and add this research to your question.

### Deleting messages

Please don't delete your messages. If you found the answer to your problem yourself, just say so share it with us. That way everyone can learn.

### Spoon feeding

You are all here to learn, so we try to avoid "spoon-feed" answers. Ideally we walk you through the thought process, so you can find the answer yourself, and become better at learning at the same time.
