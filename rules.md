# Server Rules

We don't want to be too strict and don't have many rules, but have found through experience some rules (or guidelines if you will), are necessary for keeping the peace and creating a most welcoming and inclusive space.

Please follow these respectfully. If you don't, we maintain the right to kick you from our server.

## Our rules

1. Do not abuse, belittle, insult, or threaten anyone. Any reports of abuse will be logged and will lead to a permanent ban. We don't allow rude behavior directed towards anyone.

2. Keep all discussions in the correct channels.

3. Spam is not tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, posting the same question to multiple channels and general advertising of products and services. If you're not sure, ask an admin before posting.

4. No NSFW content.

5. Do not self promote or advertise other discord servers without prior permission from an Administrator. The only exception to this rule is linking another user to a server mentioned previously in one of the chats, that is tech related.

6. Piracy is not tolerated. Do not promote, discuss, or otherwise encourage piracy of any kind. This also goes for any external Terms of Service.

7. No DMs - you will be warned once, then you will be banned (upon screenshotted proof of DMs). Report any unsolicited DMs to an Admin. **This includes unsolicited friend requests.** Discord has added private threads - use these instead of DMs. This also allows admins to help moderate these conversations.

8. Nobody is going to sell you their UpWork or other account. **Don't ask.** Banning will ensue.

9. Always use common sense and be respectful of the time and effort people spend to help people here.

10. No politics. No religion. No anything that may start a fight at a family reunion.

## Related guidelines

Above are some of our hard rules that we will actively follow. This leaves some grey area for which we want to warn you. If you go in this direction, know you're on thin ice.

If you don't know how a person will take a "joke", don't make the joke. We want this server to be as safe and welcoming as possible.

If you have any issues with anything/anyone on this server, please PM an administrator with all relevant details. We cannot help anyone if we aren't aware of an issue.

## Summary

Look, basically, we like to help, but weâ€™ll hold you to a standard as well. 

Help us help you. And do it all with respect of the members here that are volunteering time to help.
